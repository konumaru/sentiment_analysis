This app sucks!!!Rakuten has a really bad development team for this app. Even with high speed WiFi connection, live video stops quite often and whenever you want to cast the video on TV, the pop up screen for PIN code recognition freezes, EVERY SINGLE TIME! Fixed it, rakuten, be at least basically professional if youâ€™re going to charge people.
