Horrible in every aspectShocking rebranding to what it used to be a very decent NBA TV app. Wish I can give 0 stars. Rakuten seems to care about its brand (which has a bad reputation btw) way more than the NBA and the true fans. Forcing fans to sign up for an unrelated e commerce platform, lack of connectivity to Apple TV, content and interface in Japanese ONLY for a company who pretends to be a global company only to name few limitations among many!Garbage! Pure garbage, huge disservice and lack of the respect to the franchise.
