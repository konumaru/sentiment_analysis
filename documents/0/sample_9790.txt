Stolen pleasureThe only good thing about this app is it’s content. Everything else is so bad. They’ve stolen the pleasure of watching NBA games by forcing us to use this app. Unfortunately there’s no alternative, so I’ll keep using it this season.Hopefully they’ll improve something or I’ll stop watching NBA from next season.
