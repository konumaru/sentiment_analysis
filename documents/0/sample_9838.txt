Absolute Joke, NBANo English support, no Apple TV app or ability to cast (screencast only), some games only have commentary in Japanese for either away or home team. Also requires a Japan Apple account so if you have one from another country, you have to constantly change just to update the stupid thing. NBA Rakuten is terrible terrible terrible. Last year the NBA League Pass available in Japan was perfect. This offering is a giant leap backwards. Shame on you NBA.
