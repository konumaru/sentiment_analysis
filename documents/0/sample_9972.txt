Rakuten’s version of the NBA TV app is terribleThis year, Rakuten replaced the NBA TV app with their own version and it is terrible for the following reasons:1 - not able to use with Apple TV or to mirror the broadcast on a large screen device2 - no condensed games (without commercial breaks and halftime) or three- minute highlights3 - no English interface4 - not able to use the app outside of Japan ( you can only use the Rakuten version of the app if your app account is in Japan).All of these features were available on the official NBA TV app that was purchased through Rakuten last year.  Come on Rakuten - you sponsor the Warriors and claim to be striving to be a “Global” company.  Bring your product up to global standards!
