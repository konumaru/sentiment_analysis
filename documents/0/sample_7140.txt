To long to delivery and a really complicated interface.Well, I did buy twice from rakuten and I have no intention to use it again, it is difficult to find what you want, take at least 3 weeks to delivery, there’s no assiste to cancel the order, you have to talk directly with the seller and the order is only canceled if the seller want it too, and the refund is a 90 Days. So, just don’t use it if you need something. My order was placed June 2 and it is the second time that the seller change the delivery day, now they gonna delivery at July 15 what should be already here at June 10.
