No condensed game after live programming4. No multi-game streaming5. No multiple camera angle viewing options6. No wide-screen view on iOS7. Unstable live streaming 8. Forced sign up to rakuten’s garbage e-commerce platform9. Non-game content on the app is garbage10. Rakuten branding unnecessarily plastered everywhereIf NBA doesn’t buy back their business from these amateurs, I’m out and so are all 30 fans in my fantasy leagues and every other fan I can spread the word to.
